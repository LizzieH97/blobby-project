            Mr Blobby was originally featured on the British show called Noel's
            House Party (BBC). Created by Charlie Adams, a writer for the show,
            Mr Blobby is a ridiulous pink figure who has many large yellow
            spots, with a horrific smile and haunting green jiggling eyes. Mr
            Blobby can only say the word "blobby" in an electronically altered
            voice, but this does not stop him from conveying varying levels of
            rage through his intonations. Somehow he topped the UK Singles Chart
            in 1999 with a Christmas song simply called "Mr Blobby".
